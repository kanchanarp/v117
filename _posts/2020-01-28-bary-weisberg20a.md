title: Distribution Free Learning with Local Queries
abstract: "  The model of learning with <em>local membership queries</em> interpolates
  between the PAC model and the membership queries model by allowing the learner to
  query the label of any example that is similar to an example in the training set.
  This model, recently proposed and studied by Aawasthi et al (2012),  aims to facilitate
  practical use of membership queries. We continue this line of work, proving both
  positive and negative results in the <em>distribution free</em> setting. We restrict
  to the boolean cube $\\{-1, 1\\}^n$, and say that a query is $q$-local if it is
  of a hamming distance $\\le q$ from some training example. On the positive side,
  we show that $1$-local queries already give an additional strength, and allow to
  learn a certain type of DNF formulas, that are not learnable without queries, assuming
  that learning decision trees is hard. On the negative side, we show that even $\\left(n^{0.99}\\right)$-local
  queries cannot help to learn various classes including Automata, DNFs and more.
  Likewise, $q$-local queries for any constant $q$ cannot help to learn Juntas, Decision
  Trees, Sparse Polynomials and more. Moreover, for these classes, an algorithm that
  uses $\\left(\\log^{0.99}(n)\\right)$-local queries would lead to a breakthrough
  in the best known running times"
