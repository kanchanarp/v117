title: 'Planning in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning: Guarantees for Using Local
  Policies'
abstract: We consider a setting of hierarchical reinforcement learning, in which the
  reward is a sum of components. For each component, we are given a policy that maximizes
  it, and our goal is to assemble a policy from the individual policies that maximize
  the sum of the components. We provide theoretical guarantees for assembling such
  policies in deterministic MDPs with collectible rewards. Our approach builds on
  formulating this problem as a traveling salesman problem with a discounted reward.
  We focus on local solutions, i.e., policies that only use information from the current
  state; thus, they are easy to implement and do not require substantial computational
  resources. We propose three local stochastic policies and prove that they guarantee
  better performance than any deterministic local policy in the worst case; experimental
  results suggest that they also perform better on average.
