title: Optimal $δ$-Correct Best-Arm Selection for Heavy-Tailed Distributions
abstract: "\tGiven a finite set of unknown distributions $\\textit{or arms}$ that
  can be sampled, we consider the problem of identifying the one with the largest
  mean using a delta-correct algorithm (an  adaptive, sequential algorithm that restricts
  the probability of error to a specified delta) that has minimum sample complexity.
  \  Lower bounds for delta-correct algorithms are well known. Delta-correct algorithms
  that match the lower bound asymptotically as delta reduces to zero have  been previously
  developed  when arm distributions are restricted to a single parameter exponential
  family. In this paper, we first observe a negative result that some restrictions
  are essential, as otherwise under a delta-correct algorithm, distributions with
  unbounded support would require an infinite number of samples in expectation. We
  then propose a delta-correct algorithm that matches the lower bound as delta reduces
  to zero under the mild restriction that a known bound on the expectation of a non-negative,
  continuous, increasing convex function (for example, the squared moment) of the
  underlying random variables, exists.  We also propose batch processing and identify
  near optimal batch sizes to substantially speed up the proposed algorithm.     The
  best-arm problem  has many learning applications, including  recommendation systems
  and product selection.  It  is also a well studied classic problem in the simulation
  community. "
