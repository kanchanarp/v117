title: Thompson Sampling for Adversarial Bit Prediction
abstract: We study the Thompson sampling algorithm in an adversarial setting, specifically,
  for adversarial bit prediction. We characterize the bit sequences with the smallest
  and largest expected regret. Among sequences of length $T$ with $k < \frac{T}{2}$
  zeros, the  sequences of largest regret consist of alternating  zeros and ones followed
  by the remaining ones, and the sequence  of smallest regret consists of  ones followed
  by zeros. We also bound the regret of those sequences, the worst case sequences
  have regret  $O(\sqrt{T})$ and the best case sequence have regret  $O(1)$. We extend
  our results to a model where false positive and false negative errors have different
  weights. We characterize the sequences with largest  expected regret in this generalized
  setting, and derive their regret bounds. We also show that there are sequences with
  $O(1)$ regret.
