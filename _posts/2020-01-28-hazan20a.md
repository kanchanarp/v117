title: The Nonstochastic Control Problem
abstract: We consider the problem of controlling an unknown linear dynamical system
  in the presence of (nonstochastic) adversarial perturbations and adversarial convex
  loss functions. In contrast to classical control, the a priori determination of
  an optimal controller here is hindered by the latterâ€™s dependence on the yet unknown
  perturbations and costs. Instead, we measure regret against an optimal linear policy
  in hindsight, and give the first efficient algorithm that guarantees a sublinear
  regret bound, scaling as T^(2/3), in this setting.
