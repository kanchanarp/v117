title: An adaptive stochastic optimization algorithm for resource allocation
abstract: We consider the classical problem of sequential resource allocation where
  a decision maker must repeatedly divide a budget between several resources, each
  with diminishing returns. This can be recast as a specific stochastic optimization
  problem where the objective is to maximize the cumulative reward, or equivalently
  to minimize the regret. We construct an algorithm that is <em>adaptive</em> to the
  complexity of the problem, expressed in term of the regularity of the returns of
  the resources, measured by the exponent in the ≈Åojasiewicz inequality (or by their
  universal concavity parameter). Our parameter-independent algorithm recovers the
  optimal rates for strongly-concave functions and the classical fast rates of multi-armed
  bandit (for linear reward functions). Moreover, the algorithm improves existing
  results on stochastic optimization in this regret minimization setting for intermediate
  cases.
