title: What relations are reliably embeddable in Euclidean space?
abstract: We consider the problem of embedding a relation, represented as a directed
  graph, into Euclidean space. For three types of embeddings motivated by the recent
  literature on knowledge graphs, we obtain characterizations of which relations they
  are able to capture, as well as bounds on the minimal dimensionality and precision
  needed.
