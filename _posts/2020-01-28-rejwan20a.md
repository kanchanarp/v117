title: Top-$k$ Combinatorial Bandits with Full-Bandit Feedback
abstract: Top-$k$ Combinatorial Bandits generalize multi-armed bandits, where at each
  round any subset of $k$ out of $n$ arms may be chosen and the sum of the rewards
  is gained. We address the full-bandit feedback, in which the agent observes only
  the sum of rewards, in contrast to the semi-bandit feedback, in which the agent
  observes also the individual arms’ rewards. We present the <em>Combinatorial Successive
  Accepts and Rejects</em> (CSAR) algorithm, which generalizes SAR (Bubeck et al.,
  2013) for top-k combinatorial bandits. Our main contribution is an efficient sampling
  scheme that uses Hadamard matrices in order to estimate accurately the individual
  arms’ expected rewards. We discuss two variants of the algorithm, the first minimizes
  the sample complexity and the second minimizes the regret.  We also prove a lower
  bound on sample complexity, which is tight for $k=O(1)$. Finally, we run experiments
  and show that our algorithm outperforms other methods.
