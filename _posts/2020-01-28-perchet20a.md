title: Finding Robust Nash equilibria
abstract: When agents or decision maker have uncertainties of underlying parameters,
  they may want to take “robust” decisions that are optimal against the worst possible
  values of those parameters, leading to some max-min optimization problems. With
  several agents in competition, in game theory, uncertainties are even more important
  and robust games - or game with non-unique prior - have gained a lot of interest
  recently, notably in auctions. The existence of  robust equilibria in those games
  is guaranteed using standard fixed point theorems as in classical finite games,
  so we focus on the problem of finding and characterizing them. Under some linear
  assumption on the structure of the uncertainties, we provide a polynomial reduction
  of the robust Nash problem to a standard Nash problem (on some auxiliary different
  game). This is possible by proving the existence of a lifting transforming robust
  linear programs into standard linear programs.  In the general case, the above direct
  reduction is not always possible. However, we prove how to adapt the Lemke-Howson
  algorithm to find robust Nash equilibria  in non-degenerate games.
