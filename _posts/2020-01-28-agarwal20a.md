title: Leverage Score Sampling for Faster Accelerated Regression and ERM
abstract: Given a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\R^{n\times d}$ and a vector $b\in\R^{d}$,
  we show how to compute an $\epsilon$-approximate solution to the regression problem  $
  \min_{x\in\R^{d}}\frac{1}{2} \norm{\mathbf{A} x-b}_{2}^{2} $ in time $ \widetilde{O}
  ((n+\sqrt{d\cdot\kappa_{\text{sum}}}) s \log\epsilon^{-1}) $ where $\kappa_{\text{sum}}=\tr\left(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{A}\right)/\lambda_{\min}(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{A})$
  and $s$ is the maximum number of non-zero entries in a row of $\mathbf{A}$. This
  improves upon the previous best running time of  $ \widetilde{O} ((n+\sqrt{n \cdot\kappa_{\text{sum}}})
  s \log\epsilon^{-1})$. We achieve our result through an interesting combination
  of leverage score sampling, proximal point methods, and accelerated coordinate descent
  methods. Further, we show that our method not only matches the performance of previous
  methods up to polylogarithmic factors, but further improves whenever leverage scores
  of rows are small. We also provide a non-linear generalization of these results
  that improves the running time for solving a broader class of ERM problems and expands
  the set of ERM problems provably solvable in nearly linear time.
