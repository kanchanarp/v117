title: Optimal multiclass overfitting by sequence reconstruction from Hamming queries
abstract: A primary concern of excessive reuse of test datasets in machine learning
  is that it can lead to overfitting. Multiclass classification was recently shown
  to be more resistant to overfitting than binary classification. In an open problem
  of COLT 2019, Feldman, Frostig, and Hardt ask to characterize the dependence of
  the amount of overfitting bias with the number of classes $m$, the number of accuracy
  queries $k$, and the number of examples in the dataset $n$.  We resolve this problem
  and determine the  amount of overfitting possible in multi-class classification.
  We provide computationally efficient algorithms that achieve overfitting bias of  $\tilde{\Theta}(\max\{\sqrt{{k}/{(mn)}},
  k/n\})$, matching the known upper bounds.
