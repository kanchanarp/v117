title: Cautious Limit Learning
abstract: We investigate language learning in the limit from text with various <em>cautious</em>
  learning restrictions. Learning is <em>cautious</em> if no hypothesis is a proper
  subset of a previous guess. While dealing with a seemingly natural learning behaviour,
  cautious learning does severely restrict explanatory (syntactic) learning power.
  To further understand why exactly this loss of learning power arises, Kötzing and
  Palenta (2016) introduced weakened versions of cautious learning and gave first
  partial results on their relation. In this paper, we aim to understand the restriction
  of cautious learning more fully. To this end we compare the known variants in a
  number of different settings, namely full-information and (partially) set-driven
  learning, paired either with the syntactic convergence restriction (explanatory
  learning) or the semantic convergence restriction (behaviourally correct learning).
  To do so, we make use of normal forms presented in Kötzing et al. (2017), most notably
  strongly locking and consistent learning. While strongly locking learners have been
  exploited when dealing with a variety of syntactic learning restrictions, we show
  how they can be beneficial in the semantic case as well. Furthermore, we expand
  the normal forms to a broader range of learning restrictions, including an answer
  to the open question of whether cautious learners can be assumed to be consistent,
  as stated in Kötzing et al. (2017).
