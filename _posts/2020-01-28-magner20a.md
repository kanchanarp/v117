title: Toward universal testing of dynamic network models
abstract: 'Numerous networks in the real world change over time, in the sense that
  nodes and edges enter and leave the networks.  Various dynamic random graph models
  have been  proposed to explain the macroscopic properties of these systems and  to
  provide a foundation for statistical inferences and predictions. It is of interest
  to have a rigorous way to determine how well these models match observed networks.
  We thus ask the following <em>goodness of fit</em> question:  given a sequence of
  observations/snapshots of a growing random  graph,  along with a candidate model
  $M$, can we determine whether the snapshots came from $M$ or from some arbitrary
  alternative model that is well-separated from $M$ in some natural  metric?  We formulate
  this problem precisely and boil it down to goodness of fit testing for graph-valued,
  infinite-state Markov  processes and exhibit and analyze a universal test based
  on  <em>non-stationary sampling</em> for a natural class of models.'
