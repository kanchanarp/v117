title: On the Analysis of EM for truncated mixtures of two Gaussians
abstract: Motivated by a recent result of Daskalakis et al. (2018), we analyze the
  population version of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the case of \textit{truncated}
  mixtures of two Gaussians. Truncated samples from a $d$-dimensional mixture of two
  Gaussians $\frac{1}{2} \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}, \vec{\Sigma})+ \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{N}(-\vec{\mu},
  \vec{\Sigma})$ means that a sample is only revealed if it falls in some subset $S
  \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of positive (Lebesgue) measure. We show that for $d=1$, EM
  converges almost surely (under random initialization) to the true mean (variance
  $\sigma^2$ is known) for any measurable set $S$. Moreover, for $d>1$ we show EM
  almost surely converges to the true mean for any measurable set $S$ when the map
  of EM has only three fixed points, namely $-\vec{\mu}, \vec{0}, \vec{\mu}$ (covariance
  matrix $\vec{\Sigma}$ is known), and prove local convergence if there are more than
  three fixed points. We also provide convergence rates of our findings. Our techniques
  deviate from those of Daskalakis et al. (2017), which heavily depend on symmetry
  that the untruncated problem exhibits. For example, for an arbitrary measurable
  set $S$, it is impossible to compute a closed form of the update rule of EM. Moreover,
  arbitrarily truncating the mixture, induces further correlations among the variables.
  We circumvent these challenges by using techniques from dynamical systems, probability
  and statistics; implicit function theorem, stability analysis around the fixed points
  of the update rule of EM and correlation inequalities (FKG).
