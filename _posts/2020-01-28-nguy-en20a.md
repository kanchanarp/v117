title: Efficient Private Algorithms for Learning Large-Margin Halfspaces
abstract: We present new differentially private algorithms for learning a large-margin
  halfspace.  In contrast to previous algorithms, which are based on either differentially
  private simulations of the statistical query model or on private convex optimization,
  the sample complexity of our algorithms depends only on the margin of the data,
  and not on the dimension.  We complement our results with a lower bound, showing
  that the dependence of our upper bounds on the margin is optimal.
