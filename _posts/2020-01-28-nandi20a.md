title: Privately Answering Classification Queries in the Agnostic PAC Model
abstract: We revisit the problem of differentially private release of classification
  queries. In this problem, the goal is to design an algorithm that can accurately
  answer a sequence of classification queries based on a private training set while
  ensuring differential privacy. We formally study this problem in the agnostic PAC
  model and derive a new upper bound on the private sample complexity. Our results
  improve over those obtained in a recent work (Bassily et al., 2018) for the agnostic
  PAC setting. In particular, we give an improved construction that yields a tighter
  upper bound on the sample complexity. Moreover, unlike (Bassily et al., 2018), our
  accuracy guarantee does not involve any blow-up in the approximation error associated
  with the given hypothesis class. Given any hypothesis class with VC-dimension $d$,
  we show that our construction can privately answer up to $m$ classification queries
  with average excess error $\alpha$ using a private sample of size $\approx \frac{d}{\alpha^2}\,\max\left(1,
  \sqrt{m}\,\alpha^{3/2}\right)$. Using recent results on private learning with auxiliary
  public data, we extend our construction to show that one can privately answer any
  number of classification queries with average excess error $\alpha$ using a private
  sample of size $\approx \frac{d}{\alpha^2}\,\max\left(1, \sqrt{d}\,\alpha\right)$.
  When $\alpha=O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$, our private sample complexity bound
  is essentially optimal.
