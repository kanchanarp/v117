title: Approximate Representer Theorems in Non-reflexive Banach Spaces
abstract: The representer theorem is one of the most important mathematical foundations
  for regularised learning and kernel methods. Classical formulations of the theorem
  state sufficient conditions under which a regularisation problem on a Hilbert space
  admits a solution in the subspace spanned by the representers of the data points.
  This turns the problem into an equivalent optimisation problem in a finite dimensional
  space, making it computationally tractable. Moreover, Banach space methods for learning
  have been receiving more and more attention. Considering the representer theorem
  in Banach spaces is hence of increasing importance. Recently the question of the
  necessary condition for a representer theorem to hold in Hilbert spaces and certain
  Banach spaces has been considered. It has been shown that a classical representer
  theorem cannot exist in general in non-reflexive Banach spaces. In this paper we
  propose a notion of approximate solutions and approximate representer theorem to
  overcome this problem. We show that for these notions we can indeed extend the previous
  results to obtain a unified theory for the existence of representer theorems in
  any general Banach spaces, in particular including $l^1$-type spaces. We give a
  precise characterisation when a regulariser admits a classical representer theorem
  and when only an approximate representer theorem is possible.
