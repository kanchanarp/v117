title: On Learnability wih Computable Learners
abstract: We initiate a study of learning with computable learners and computable
  output predictors. Recent results in statistical learning theory have shown that
  there are basic learning problems whose learnability can not be determined within
  ZFC.  This motivates us to consider learnability by algorithms with computable output
  predictors (both learners and predictors are then representable as finite objects).
  We thus propose the notion of <em>CPAC learnability</em>, by adding some basic computability
  requirements into a PAC learning framework. As a first step towards a characterization,
  we show that in this framework learnability of a binary hypothesis class is not
  implied by finiteness of its VC-dimension anymore.  We also present some situations
  where we are guaranteed to have a computable learner.
