title: Feedback graph regret bounds for Thompson Sampling and UCB
abstract: We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with the graph-based
  feedback structure introduced by Mannor and Shamir. We analyze the performance of
  the two most prominent stochastic bandit algorithms, Thompson Sampling and Upper
  Confidence Bound (UCB), in the graph-based feedback setting. We show that these
  algorithms achieve  regret guarantees that combine the graph structure and the gaps
  between the means of the arm distributions. Surprisingly this holds despite the
  fact that these algorithms do not explicitly use the graph structure to select arms;
  they observe the additional feedback but do not explore based on it. Towards this
  result we introduce a <em>layering technique</em> highlighting the commonalities
  in the two algorithms.
