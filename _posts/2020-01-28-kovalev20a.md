title: 'Don’t Jump Through Hoops and Remove Those Loops:  SVRG and Katyusha are Better
  Without the Outer Loop'
abstract: The stochastic variance-reduced gradient method (<tt>SVRG</tt>) and its
  accelerated variant (<tt>Katyusha</tt>) have attracted enormous attention in the
  machine learning community in the last few years due to their superior theoretical
  properties and empirical behaviour on training supervised machine learning models
  via the empirical risk minimization paradigm. A key structural element in both of
  these methods is the inclusion of an outer loop at the beginning of which  a full
  pass over the training data is made in order to compute the exact gradient, which
  is then used in an inner loop to construct a variance-reduced estimator of the gradient
  using new stochastic gradient information. In this work, we design <em>loopless
  variants</em> of both of these methods. In particular,  we remove the outer loop
  and replace its function by a coin flip performed in each iteration designed to
  trigger, with a small probability, the computation of the gradient. We prove that
  the new methods enjoy the same superior theoretical convergence properties as the
  original methods. For loopless <tt>SVRG</tt>,  the same rate is obtained for a large
  interval of coin flip probabilities, including the probability $\frac{1}{n}$, where
  $n$ is the number of functions. This is the first result where a variant of <tt>SVRG</tt>
  is shown to converge with the same rate without the need for the algorithm to know
  the condition number, which is often unknown or hard to estimate correctly. We demonstrate
  through numerical experiments that the loopless methods can have  superior and more
  robust practical behavior.
