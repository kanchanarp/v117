title: On the Expressive Power of Kernel Methods  and the Efficiency of Kernel Learning
  by Association Schemes
abstract: We study the expressive power of kernel methods and the algorithmic feasibility
  of multiple kernel learning for a special rich class of kernels.  Specifically,
  we define <em>Euclidean kernels</em>, a diverse class that includes most, if not
  all, families of kernels studied in literature such as polynomial kernels and radial
  basis functions. We then describe the geometric and spectral structure of this family
  of kernels over the hypercube (and to some extent for any compact domain).  Our
  structural results allow us to prove meaningful limitations on the expressive power
  of the class as well as derive several efficient algorithms for learning kernels
  over different domains.
