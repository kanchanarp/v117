title: First-Order Bayesian Regret Analysis of Thompson Sampling
abstract: We address online combinatorial optimization when the player has a prior
  over the adversary’s sequence of losses. In this setting, Russo and Van Roy proposed
  an information-theoretic analysis of Thompson Sampling based on the <em>information
  ratio</em>, allowing for elegant proofs of Bayesian regret bounds. In this paper
  we introduce three novel ideas to this line of work. First we propose a new quantity,
  the scale-sensitive information ratio, which allows us to obtain more refined first-order
  regret bounds (i.e., bounds of the form $O(\sqrt{L^*})$ where $L^*$ is the loss
  of the best combinatorial action). Second we replace the entropy over combinatorial
  actions by a <em>coordinate entropy</em>, which allows us to obtain the first optimal
  worst-case bound for Thompson Sampling in the combinatorial setting. We additionally
  introduce a novel link between Bayesian agents and frequentist confidence intervals.
  Combining these ideas we show that the classical multi-armed bandit first-order
  regret bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d L^*})$ still holds true in the more challenging
  and more general semi-bandit scenario. This latter result improves the previous
  state of the art bound $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(d+m^3)L^*})$ by Lykouris, Sridharan and
  Tardos. We tighten these results by leveraging a recent insight of Zimmert and Lattimore
  connecting Thompson Sampling and online stochastic mirror descent, which allows
  us to replace the Shannon entropy with more general mirror maps.
