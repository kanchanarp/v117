title: Robust guarantees for learning an autoregressive filter
abstract: The optimal predictor for a known linear dynamical system (with hidden state
  and Gaussian noise) takes the form of an autoregressive linear filter, namely the
  Kalman filter. However, making optimal predictions in an unknown linear dynamical
  system is a more challenging problem that is fundamental to control theory and reinforcement
  learning. To this end, we take the approach of directly learning an autoregressive
  filter for time-series prediction under unknown dynamics. Our analysis differs from
  previous statistical analyses in that we regress not only on the inputs to the dynamical
  system, but also the outputs, which is essential to dealing with process noise.
  The main challenge is to estimate the filter under worst case input (in $\mathcal
  H_\infty$ norm), for which we use an $L^\infty$-based objective rather than ordinary
  least-squares. For learning an autoregressive model, our algorithm has optimal sample
  complexity in terms of the rollout length, which does not seem to be attained by
  naive least-squares.
