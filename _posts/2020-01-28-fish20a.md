title: Sampling Without Compromising Accuracy in Adaptive Data Analysis
abstract: In this work, we study how to use sampling to speed up mechanisms for answering
  adaptive queries into datasets without reducing the accuracy of those mechanisms.  This
  is important to do when both the datasets and the number of queries asked are very
  large.  In particular, we describe a mechanism that provides a polynomial speed-up
  per query over previous mechanisms, without needing to increase the total amount
  of data required to maintain the same generalization error as before.  We prove
  that this speed-up holds for arbitrary statistical queries.  We also provide an
  even faster method for achieving statistically-meaningful responses wherein the
  mechanism is only allowed to see a constant number of samples from the data per
  query.  Finally, we show that our general results yield a simple, fast, and unified
  approach for adaptively optimizing convex and strongly convex functions over a dataset.
