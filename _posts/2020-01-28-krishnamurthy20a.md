title: Algebraic and Analytic Approaches for Parameter Learning in Mixture Models
abstract: We present two different approaches for parameter learning in several mixture
  models in one dimension. Our first approach uses complex-analytic methods and applies
  to Gaussian mixtures with shared variance, binomial mixtures with shared success
  probability, and Poisson mixtures, among others. An example result is that $\exp(O(N^{1/3}))$
  samples suffice to exactly learn a mixture of $k<N$ Poisson distributions, each
  with integral rate parameters bounded by $N$. Our second approach uses algebraic
  and combinatorial tools and applies to binomial mixtures with shared trial parameter
  $N$ and differing success parameters, as well as to mixtures of geometric distributions.
  Again, as an example, for binomial mixtures with $k$ components and success parameters
  discretized to resolution $\epsilon$, $O(k^2(\nicefrac{N}{\epsilon})^{\nicefrac{8}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}})$
  samples suffice to exactly recover the parameters. For some of these distributions,
  our results represent the first guarantees for parameter estimation.
