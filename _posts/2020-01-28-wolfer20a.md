title: Mixing Time Estimation in Ergodic Markov Chains from a Single Trajectory with
  Contraction Methods
abstract: The mixing time $t_{\mathsf{mix}}$ of an ergodic Markov chain measures the
  rate of  convergence towards its stationary distribution $\boldsymbol{\pi}$. We
  consider the problem of estimating $t_{\mathsf{mix}}$ from one single trajectory  of
  $m$ observations $(X_1, …, X_m)$,  in the case where the transition kernel $\boldsymbol{M}$
  is unknown, a research program started by Hsu et al. [2015]. The community has so
  far focused primarily on leveraging spectral methods to estimate the <em>relaxation
  time</em> $t_{\mathsf{rel}}$ of a <em>reversible</em> Markov chain as a proxy for
  $t_{\mathsf{mix}}$. Although these techniques have recently been extended to tackle
  non-reversible chains,  this general setting remains much less understood. Our new
  approach based on contraction methods is the first that aims at directly  estimating
  $t_{\mathsf{mix}}$ up to multiplicative small universal constants instead of $t_{\mathsf{rel}}$.
  It does so by introducing a generalized version of Dobrushin’s contraction coefficient
  $\kappa_{\mathsf{gen}}$, which is shown to control the mixing time regardless of
  reversibility. We subsequently design fully data-dependent high confidence intervals
  around $\kappa_{\mathsf{gen}}$  that generally yield better convergence guarantees
  and  are more practical than state-of-the-art.
